# Exercise 1

I have to make a program that prompts for input with the text "What is your name?"
Then it will output: "Hello, &lt;name&gt;, nice to meet you!"

So, I need to figure out the following things in Scala before I have all the pieces necessary:

1. How to print to the screen.
2. How to prompt for input.
3. How to store information.
4. How to interpolate or concatenate.

So, let me get to learning.

## Observations

* stored values are immutable.
* the book I am using presents val before var.  val's are immutable (and unreassignable). var is the variable that I am used to.
* Unit is probably important... Kinda like NilClass in Ruby, null in C# (JS is a bit more loosey-goosey about this aspect).

 

## Progress

* I know how to print
* I know how to store values
* I know how to concatenate

I still need to figure out how to prompt for input...

## Challenges

Now that I have finished the first exercise, on to the first challenge.  Repeat the app, but without using variables (I will assume they mean not using vals either).

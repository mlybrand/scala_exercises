# Exercise 1

I have to make a program that prompts for input with the text "What is your name?"
Then it will output: "Hello, &lt;name&gt;, nice to meet you!"

1. How to print to the screen.
2. How to prompt for input.
3. How to store information.
4. How to interpolate or concatenate.

So, let me get to learning.

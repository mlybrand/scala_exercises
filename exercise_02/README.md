## Exercise 2

This exercise requires you to prompt for an input string and then to print the string and print out the number of characters in said string.

I don't currently know how to get string length, so I will move a little further along in my book (although, like io.StdIn.readLine, I kind of doubt that the solution will be forthcoming and I will end up googling for the answer in a couple of days).
